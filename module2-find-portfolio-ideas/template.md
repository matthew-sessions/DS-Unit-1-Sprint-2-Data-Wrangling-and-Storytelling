# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
I care about marketing, geopolitics, real-estate, investing and golf.

What do you know about?
I have a good understanding of digital marketing and international trade.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
For trade, I can show an increased number of transhipments from China over a period of time.

2. Trend related to the news
A transhipment plot would relate to what is going on with the trade war.

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about
I could pull audience data from the Facebook Marketing API‌ for better targeting. Answering the question: “How do I lower my CPR with Data Sciences?” is a question many marketers would care about.

5. Valuable to businesses
Application that pulls and organizes the Facebook Marketing API.

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
In the book Dataclysm there are many insights about human nature in regards to dating. I learned a lot from that book and would like to replicate a few charts from it.

Insights about dating were not particularly interesting to me, but the way Christian Rudder used the data to better his product is inspiring.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
One question from the book:‌ “Are men or women pickier when selecting a partner?”

I don’t think I could draw a new hypothesis from this.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Yes

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
For marketing the Facebook Marketing API is a good source of data.
For real-estate Zillow has great data.

For Trade data.gov has data but I have not yet found what I am looking for.
